                <h1 class="hero">Hey, <br>I'm Lucas Santos! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
                <p>I'm currently learning <s>Web Development with a focus on front-end.</s></p>
                <p> Thu, 09/03/2023 20:03: E V E R Y T H I N G. My goal is to do whatever is necessary to get a headstart in my own business.</p>
                <p> Of course, it's not everything, I don't want to be a jack-of-all-trades, once I'm earning more I could just hire somebody to work on my innumerous ideas, but I'm trying to do things right, let it flow to what I believe I must do.</p>
                <p>That's my approach to my years-long failed projects that never saw the light of the day.</p>
                <p>If I could get good at sales and marketing, that's something that can't be delegated. There is just so much I can get experienced on.</p>

                <h1 class="hero"> This is my first blog post on the internet lol </h1>
                <h2>Thu, 09/03/2023 19:29 UTC -03:00</h2>
                <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Start writing a blog just for the sake of it</h3>
                <p>Generally I write a lot of notes privately in OneNote, but now I'll start the habit of writing for publication somewhere with no expectations.</p>
                <p>I was inspired by a friend of mine. Excuse the plataform, this was a 3 year old template I had written in 5 minutes lol.</p>
                <p>I literally don't have an optimized UI for blogging here, I'm typing the HTML by hand on github.</p>
                <p>I realized today that most of my insecurities that keeps me away from accomplishing the things I want is because I'm too afraid of just starting things right away that are important, <b>I had for my whole life this habit of being too much of a consumer and not enough a producer, too afraid if what I was doing is good enough, draning my motivation/flow-state unnecesarily.</b></p>
                <p>What we are ultimately looking for is a connection, to ourselves, to the people and things around us. Procrastination is your failure to <i>feel in a viceral level</i> how sweet and healing is what you are procrastinating on.</p>
                <p>We have lost clarity of the vision, during the hours and days before it, your mind were probably wandering to a million other things.</p>
                <p>Which is okay, however, if vicerally we could at least put ourselves together in a very Jordan Petersonian way of thinking.</p>
                <p>We will have plenty of time and fruits of our work to cheerish. A lot of people want to exit working in a 9/5, however, the system breed them in such a way they are vicerally castrated into pulling off so many of the things they might want to do, but can't because their minds, habits, sub-conscious triggers calcified their minds from the possibility of change.</p>
                <p><br>It's 09/03/2023 19:56 right now, I should be executing on my sleep hygine habits, at least, my bedroom is dark right now, and my mind isn't filled with that deadly "one more thing before we go to sleep" state of mind.</p>
                <p>I'll leave you my reader, with this excerpt from my favorite lusophone writter. Fernando Pessoa.</p>
